### Building

- Extract the zip of this project
- Type the follow command:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
```

> if you want with debug symbols put the flag `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

- After CMake config your project build:

```sh
cmake --build build
```

- Inside the build folder are another folder (named the same as the project name on CMakeLists.txt) with the executable and resources folder.
- In order for resources to load properly, cd to `src` and run the executable (`../build/${PROJECT_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}`) from there.

- cmake will automatically download a current release of raylib but if you want to use your local version you can pass `-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_RAYLIB=<dir_with_raylib>`
